# Bad-Banking-app

## Description
This was a project to make a bad bank single page application that had functionality for
1. Create account
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. AllData

## Installation 
Download files and open in vscode.  Then go to live server on the bottom left of the screen and open in web browser

## Technology

## Improvements
I would like to customize a lot more of the website to give it more flare.
Would also like to display more information on the all data page like each individual transaction.
